<h1> Codenames! </h1>
<h4> A word-guessing game for 4+ people, designed by Vlaada Chv√°til.</h4>
<h3> Rules </h3>
<p> If you are unfamiliar with the rules, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)#Rules">the Wikipedia page</a> or 
  <a href="https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf">The official rules pdf</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3> Setup </h3>
<h4> Required Materials </h4>
<p>
  This version is meant to be played in-person, not online; so grab a couple of friends!<br>
  You'll want three devices to play. One for each Spymaster and one to function as the public board. <br>
  Typically, the Spymasters will use smartphones and you'll use something larger to be the public board. <br>
  Navigate to this webpage on all three devices. <br>
</p>
<h4> Seed Synchronization</h4>
<p>
  You'll want to make sure that everyone is playing the same game. <br>
  Check the value of the Seed below, and make sure it's the same on all three devices. <br>
  If they aren't, everyone should agree on a Seed to use and type it into the Seed box below and hit <kbd class='key'>Enter</kbd>.<br>
</p>
<h3> How to Play </h3>
<p>
  Some things are a little different in this digital version.<br>
  Clicking on a tile will reveal whether it belonged to Red Team, Blue Team, or was a Civilian or the Assassin.<br>
  So, try to refrain from unnecessary clicking or touching of the screen as you could accidentally reveal a spy.<br>
  <br>
  If you are a Spymaster, click the appropriate button below.<br>
  Spymasters will see a button that reveals the entire board. Just like the 'Key' card in the board game!<br>
  Unlike the physical game, Spymasters don't have to sit next to each other. Just as long as nobody else can see your phone.<br>
