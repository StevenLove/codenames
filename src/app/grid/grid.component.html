<h4> A word-guessing game designed by Vlaada Chv√°til.</h4>
<h3> Rules </h3>
<p> If you are unfamiliar with the rules, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)#Rules" target="_blank">the Wikipedia page</a> or 
  <a href="https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf" target="_blank">The official rules pdf</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3> Setup </h3>
<h4> Required Materials </h4>
<p>
  This version is meant to be played in-person, not online; so grab a couple of friends!<br>
  You'll want three devices to play. One for each Spymaster and one to function as the public board. <br>
  Typically, the Spymasters will use smartphones and you'll use something larger to be the public board. <br>
  Navigate to this webpage on all three devices. <br>
</p>
<h4> Seed Synchronization</h4>
<p>
  You'll want to make sure that everyone is playing the same game. <br>
  Check the value of the Seed below, and make sure it's the same on all three devices. <br>
  If they aren't, everyone should agree on a Seed to use and type it into the Seed box below and hit <kbd class='key'>Enter</kbd> or the Set Seed Button<br>
</p>
<h3> How to Play </h3>
<p>
  Some things are a little different in this digital version.<br>
  <br>
  For the public board...<br>
  Click the 'No!' button below, as you are not a Spymaster.<br>
  Any tile that you click on will cycle through all possible values: Red, Blue, Civilian, and Assassin.<br>
  After choosing a tile, you'll have to ask your Spymaster if you were right.<br>
  <br>
  For Spymasters...<br>
  Click the 'Yes!' button below.<br>
  The true colors should be revealed to you now. Make sure to hide this from other operatives.<br>
  You can click on tiles to hide their text.<br>
  This can reduce visual clutter and indicate which tiles have already been chosen.<br>
